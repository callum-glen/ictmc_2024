# ICTMC 2024 - Template code for estimand strategies

Contained in this GitHub repository is template code for different estimand strategies, as shown on the poster at ICTMC 2024, Edinburgh.

The .do file contains notes at the top to explain some of the code used within, such as the placeholder variables.

The example analysis is a simple regression, the code is purposely made simple so it is easier to understand the principles behind the methods, and easier to apply to other methods outside of a regression. It is advised that if a differing analysis model is used, that the estimands literature is consulted before running models.
